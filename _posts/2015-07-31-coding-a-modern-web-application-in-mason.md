I want do develop a complete web application, and I want to code it using [Mason](http://www.masonhq.com), which is a powerful templating system for generating dynamic content.

I already have some experience with the previous version (Mason1, which was called HTML::Mason) but the new version is quite different â€“ even if philosophy is intact:

[http://www.openswartz.com/2011/02/21/announcing-mason-2/](http://www.openswartz.com/2011/02/21/announcing-mason-2/)

Mason2 takes advantage of some modern perl features like "Moose", which are still a little obscure to me ;)

Why this blog? Here I want to blog whatâ€™s going on, what Iâ€™m learning, my tries and my mistakes. The project Iâ€™m working on is not completed yet, this means that I wonâ€™t follow a defined logic and it also means that I still donâ€™t know how this project will end, and if it will actually end ;)

I know cannot consider myself a perl expert, I feel more like a perl "artist", I can make some nice and creative works even if my perl code is "sloppy" and imperfect ;) However, I always like to improve and learn how to code better. I don't like sloppy code, I like elegant solutions ;)

Since Iâ€™m always busy on my current work (databases, reportings, data analysis, and other funny stuff like this), my hobbies (music, travels, hiking), and my wife, I decided to start this blog to keep track of what Iâ€™ve done.

This blog will surely help me remember what Iâ€™ve done so far, and could also help others working on similar projects, but since Iâ€™m going to do huge mistakes and/or disasters, please donâ€™t consider it as a bibile ðŸ˜‰

Letâ€™s start!
